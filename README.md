## Haiku poetry from the Land of Enchantment

Welcome to the New Mexiku Project. While just starting out, this project aims to embrace web standards and design, through the use of technologies like Markdown, GitHub, and Jekyll. While largely a learning project for myself, I also aim to make it more open than many of my previous web projects of the past that have often over-leveraged the use of CMS platforms like WordPress or Squarespace.

## Project Goals

- Learn more code and technologies
- Create a place for poets to express themselves
